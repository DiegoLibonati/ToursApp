# ToursApp

## Educational Purpose

This project was created primarily for **educational and learning purposes**.  
While it is well-structured and could technically be used in production, it is **not intended for commercialization**.  
The main goal is to explore and demonstrate best practices, patterns, and technologies in software development.

2. Join to the correct path of the clone
3. Execute: `yarn install` or `npm install`
4. Execute: `yarn run dev` or `npm run dev` and enjoy!

## Description

I made a web application that shows different tours, of each tour you can see an image, a title, a price, a description that will have a status to show all the information or a cut out part and finally a button that you are not interested in that tour. In case of touching this button the tour will be deleted from the page.
